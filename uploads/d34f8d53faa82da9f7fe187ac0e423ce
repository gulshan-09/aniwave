        "description": "In 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia launched a campaign to conquer Japan, which was swiftly achieved within a month thanks to their use of Knightmare Frames - new mobile humanoid armor vehicles. Japan lost its rights and identity and was renamed Area 11, with its citizens, the Elevens, struggling to survive while the Britannian aristocracy lived comfortably in their settlements. Despite this, resistance groups emerged, fighting for Japan's independence. Amidst the ongoing conflict, Lelouch, an exiled Imperial Prince of Britannia, masquerades as a student. It is during this time that he crosses paths with C.C., a mysterious girl who grants him the power of the king - the Geass. With the ability to control any person, Lelouch sees an opportunity to bring down Britannia from within and realize his goal.",

Far better than those 10 years ongoing shows on television. Every emotion can be seen in the story. Best part is you don't need to spend lot of time to get entertain. No boring scenes and also continues your interest to know what next is. Don't know about others but atleast i didn't skip even 10 sec. I must say that Bhuvan was tooo good I lost myself in karan like kinda partner he is just amazing. Last but not least its an incredible show that has etched in my heart and mind forever.",

I also fall out with other reviewers who says the protagonist is anti Indian as regards culture and norms pertaining to women in Indian society.

Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?",

But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grows closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.",

She has already experienced this time loop six times and lived out those five years a different way each time, as a merchant, a doctor, a maid, a knight, and more. Now, on her seventh go-around, she's determined to live to a ripe old age and spend it relaxing. But the moment she flees the castle with that decision in her heart, she runs into the infamously cruel crown prince of a rival kingdom, Arnold Hein. He happens to be the one who killed her during her life as a knight, but now, he seems to have taken a bizarre liking to her... and begs her to become his wife.",

But in a twist of fate, he awakens in another world as Rudeus Greyrat, starting life again as a baby born to two loving parents. Preserving his memories and knowledge from his previous life, Rudeus quickly adapts to his new environment. With the mind of a grown adult, he starts to display magical talent that exceeds all expectations, honing his skill with the help of a mage named Roxy Migurdia. Rudeus learns swordplay from his father, Paul, and meets Sylphiette, a girl his age who quickly becomes his closest friend. As Rudeus' second chance at life begins, he tries to make the most of his new opportunity while conquering his traumatic past. And perhaps, one day, he may find the one thing he could not find in his old world—love.",

When trying to again return to Tempest, this time permanently, Rimuru is stopped by a mysterious figure who is somehow able to constrain the many magical abilities he has at his disposal.

However, every attempt to execute him inexplicably fails. Finally, Sagiri Yamada Asaemon, a fledgling member of a famed executioner clan, is asked to take Gabimaru's life; yet Sagiri makes no move to kill him as requested. Insisting that Gabimaru will not die because of his love for his wife, Sagiri instead offers him the chance to obtain a full pardon for his crimes. If he can travel to the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of Life—which supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then his freedom will be assured. But of the many who have traveled to Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a single person has returned sound of mind, if at all. Though unaware of the numerous dangers ahead, Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten other death row convicts—in hope that he and his wife may finally live in peace.",

Desiring to prove their skills, they look forward to the opportunity that has been given to them: a set of mock battles between the students of each class. The classes are split into squads of four, each of which is tasked with capturing the other group members. The winner is the group who first secures all of the opposing team. While this sounds simple, a curveball is thrown into the mix with the inclusion of General Course Student Hitoshi Shinsou, who wishes to transfer into the Hero Course. Despite using his training with Class 1-A's homeroom teacher Shouta Eraserhead Aizawa to prove that he's capable of being a real hero, he is still far behind the others due to his lack of experience. However, Shinsou is determined to overcome this challenge. Thus begins the fiery competition between Class 1-A and 1-B as each tries to prove that they are superior to the other.",

Cecil appoints the revived Immortal to succeed Rudy as the Guardians' leader and adds a new hero called Bulletproof to their ranks. The Maulers escape prison with help from their version of Angstrom, who tasks them with building a device capable of transferring the memories of various alternate universe variants of himself to him so he can use their collective knowledge to advance Earth's technology and save other planets. Cecil sends Mark to stop the Maulers as they begin the process, forcing Angstrom to use his multiversal powers to summon variants of the Maulers, who nearly kill Mark against his wishes. Angstrom stops the transfer prematurely, causing an explosion, which one Mauler, Mark, and a horrifically scarred Angstrom survive. Driven mad by his variants' memories of their versions of Invincible and Omni-Man, Angstrom vows revenge on Mark and escapes.",

But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.",

The Defense Corps, an elite military unit, puts their lives on the line daily to safeguard the people from these aberrations. Once the behemoths are eradicated, the Professional Kaijuu Cleaner Corporation dispatches sweepers to dispose of their remains. Kafka Hibino, a 32-year-old sweeper, is discontent with his current job. He harbours a deep-seated desire to be a member of the Defense Corps and to slay kaijuus as a profession. Despite multiple attempts, Kafka's ambition petered out, and he settled for a steady salary. However, a 18-year-old recruit named Leno Ichikawa joins his sanitation crew, reigniting Kafka's yearning for military enrolment. As he suffers a series of unfortunate events and interacts with the new sweeper, Kafka stumbles upon a parasite-like kaijuu. The monster forces its way through his mouth, and Kafka experiences a transformation into a humanoid monster. With his newfound abilities, he is determined to fulfil his lifelong aspiration.",
